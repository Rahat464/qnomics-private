            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This website is a part of Queen Mary University of Londonâ€™s qNomics Financial Literacy Programme, developed by a group of students from the School of Economics and Finance (SEF) and School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science (EECS).</p>
            <p>After implementing a survey, analysing the results, and consulting with senior leaders of the Programme, we identified several key areas to help increase Financial Literacy to help other Students in London with the Cost-of-Living Crisis.</p>
            <p>We decided to focus on Student Loans, and more specifically Student Finance England based on our survey. We identified that our fellow students had the lowest level of knowledge and understanding around two main categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Interest</strong>: How itâ€™s calculated and how it affects them and the size of their debt</li>
                <li><strong>Repayment</strong>: How it affects their take-home pay and when it starts to take effect</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Each section will have relevant information simplified and broken down to make it easier to understand.
