                <h2>How does the repayment plan affect my take-home pay? 💸</h2>
                <p>
                    If you have a student loan from the government, you will have to pay it back with interest once you finish your course and start earning above a certain amount of money.
                    This is called the repayment threshold.
                    The repayment threshold depends on which type of student loan you have and where you live.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your student loan repayments are taken automatically from your salary by your employer, along with your tax and National Insurance contributions.
                    You do not have to do anything to set this up.
                    Your repayments are based on a percentage of your income above the threshold, not on the total amount you owe.
                    The percentage varies depending on which type of student loan you have.
                    You can also make extra repayments if you want to pay off your loan faster.
                    By doing so, you may be able to reduce the amount of interest you pay.
                    However, this depends on how much you are paying towards your loan and the current interest rate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your student loan repayments will affect your take-home pay, which is the amount of money you receive after all taxes and deductions.
                    The more you earn, the more you will repay.
                    However, you will never repay more than you can afford, as your repayments are linked to your income.
                </p>
                <p>Here are some examples of how different types of student loans affect your take-home pay and when they start to take effect:</p>
